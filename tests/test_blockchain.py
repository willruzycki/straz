# def test_block_mining():

#     # Create a new block, mine it (find a valid nonce)
#     # Assert that the mined block is valid according to consensus rules
#     pass

# def test_block_validation_logic():

# smart_contract.py related tests might go into a separate test_smart_contract.py
# For now, focusing on blockchain.py

# Fork resolution might involve both blockchain.py and consensus.py,
# so those tests could be in test_consensus.py or a more general test_integration.py
